# tic-tac-toe
A simple in-terminal PvP Tic-Tac-Toe game, written in C.

## Usage
First, compile using the command `make`. Then, start the game using the command `./run`.

## How to play
The two players are given marks 'X' and 'O' respectively. They take turns placing a mark in the 3x3 grid. The first player to get 3 marks in a row (vertically, horizontally or diagonally) wins. If all 9 squares are filled with no 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a tie.
